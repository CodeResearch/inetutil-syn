These notes intend to help people working on the CVS version of
GNU Inetutils. See end of file for copying conditions.

* Prerequisites

You need the following packages to build the development version of
GNU Inetutils. We don't make any extra effort to accommodate older versions
of these packages, so please make sure that you have the latest stable
version.

- Automake <http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/>
- Autoconf <http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/>
- Bison <http://www.gnu.org/software/bison/>
- Gettext <http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/>
- Git <http://git.or.cz>
- Gnulib <http://www.gnu.org/software/gnulib/>
- Libtool <http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/>
- M4 <http://www.gnu.org/software/m4/>
- Texinfo <http://www.gnu.org/software/texinfo>

* Documentation

The accompanying documentation may be inaccurate or incomplete. For
development versions, the authoritative source of information  
about recent changes is the ChangeLog filegit log. 

For more information, see the file README-alpha.

Obviously, if you are reading these notes, you did manage to checkout
Inetutils from the repository. The next step is to get other files needed to build, which are extracted from other source packages:

1. Change to the source tree directory

   cd inetutils

2. Run

   ./bootstrap

Once done, proceed as described in the file README (section
INSTALLATION).

Normally you will have to run bootstrap only once. However, if you
intend to hack on Inetutils, you might need to run it again later. In
this case, you will probably want to save some time and bandwidth by
avoiding downloading the same files again. If so, create in Inetutils
root directory the file named `.bootstrap' with the following
contents:

   --gnulib-srcdir=$HOME/gnulib --skip-po

Replace `$HOME/gnulib' with the actual directory where the Gnulib
sources reside.

For more information about `bootstrap', run `bootstrap --help'.
